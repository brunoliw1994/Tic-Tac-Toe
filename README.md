# Tic-Tac-Toe (C#)

This project aims to remember some of the elements of C#.

The game is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe. The player will select a number for the row position and the column. The number of each row and column varies from 0-2. 

With this software, I wish to provide a different means which TIc-Tac-Toe can be played.
